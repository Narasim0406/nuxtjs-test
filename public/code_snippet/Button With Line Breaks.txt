Your best bet is a <button> so you can use a <br> inside, like:
<button>
  Some
  <br>
  Text
</button>
If you need it to be an <input>, and thus the text has to be in a value, it used to be somewhat reliable to use &#x00A; (a carriage return) to break a line in a value like this:
<input type="button" value="Really&#x00A;Tall&#x00A;Button">
That still works in Firefox, but doesnâ€™t seem to work in Chrome anymore, and is dangerous in Safari where it cuts off the text after the first entity.
