This is different from the default code that Flash provides. That typically involves the <embed> tag and is not valid XHTML. This doesnâ€™t use that, and is fully valid.
<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" 
  data="your-flash-file.swf" 
  width="0" height="0">
  <param name="movie" value="your-flash-file.swf" />
  <param name="quality" value="high"/>
</object>
